# Spring Boot Course API Tutorial

This repository is a hands-on implementation of a Spring Boot tutorial from the [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/user/koushks) channel. The project demonstrates how to build a simple Course API while exploring essential Spring Boot features, such as:

- RESTful API creation with `@RestController`.
- Business logic implementation using the `@Service` annotation.
- Dependency injection for seamless communication between components.
- Classpath scanning and automatic configuration.
- Embedded Tomcat for standalone application deployment.
